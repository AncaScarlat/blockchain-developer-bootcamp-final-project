# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
The final project from the ConsenSys Academy Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2021


Brainstorm on the idea

I am runing the Drexel Blockchain club, and every year in the spring we have elections for the following year. 
I'll crate a voting distributed application (or dapp) running on the Ethereum network (mainnet or testnet) with an interactive web-based frontend, that will allow fair elections through-out the University.


Voting Contract Example Workflow

1. Users will have to register themselves somehow on the contract.

2. They have to identify which e-board position from the club they are going to be voting on.

3. They'll have to submit a vote for that position.

4. They can't vote twice for a single position.
